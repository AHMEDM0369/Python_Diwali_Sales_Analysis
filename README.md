## Installing Jupyter and Running the Diwali Sales Analysis Project

This guide walks you through installing Jupyter Notebook, downloading the Python project for Diwali Sales Analysis from GitHub, and running the project code.

**Prerequisites:**

* Python 3 (Download from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
* Git (Download from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/))

**Step 1: Install Jupyter Notebook**

1. Open a terminal window (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on Mac/Linux).
2.  Type the following command and press Enter:

```bash
pip install jupyter
```

This command will download and install Jupyter Notebook using the `pip` package manager.

**Step 2: Clone the Diwali Sales Analysis Project from GitHub**

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to your desired project directory using the `cd` command.
2.  Type the following command and replace `AHMEDM0369` with your GitHub username:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AHMEDM0369/Python_Diwali_Sales_Analysis-python-project.git
```

This command will clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine.

**Step 3: Launch Jupyter Notebook**

1. Navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command in your terminal window.
2. Type the following command and press Enter:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This command will launch the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser, typically at http://localhost:8888.

**Step 4: Run the Data Analysis Project**

1. In the Jupyter Notebook interface, you will see a list of available notebooks in the project directory.
2. Locate the notebook named "Diwali_Sales_Analysis.ipynb" (or similar depending on the project structure).
3. Click on the notebook name to open it in the Jupyter Notebook editor.
4. The notebook contains Python code cells that perform data analysis tasks.
5. To run a code cell, click on the cell and then press `Shift + Enter` on your keyboard. 
6. The code in the cell will be executed and the results will be displayed below the cell.

**Note:**

*  You can run individual code cells or the entire notebook by clicking the "Run" menu in the top toolbar and selecting "Run Cells" or "Run All Cells".
* The specific steps may vary slightly depending on your operating system and project structure. 

**Additional Tips:**

* Make sure you have the required libraries mentioned in the project's documentation installed before running the code.
* Read the comments and documentation within the notebook to understand the code and the analysis steps performed.

By following these steps, you should be able to install Jupyter Notebook, download the Diwali Sales Analysis project from GitHub, and run the data analysis code.
